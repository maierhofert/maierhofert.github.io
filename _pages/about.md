Welcome! This website is still under construction, so be wary. 
My name is Thomas Maierhofer, I'm a lecturer in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) at the University of California, Los Angeles. My office is on the 8th floor of the [Math Sciences Building](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mathematical+Sciences+Building/@34.0700968,-118.4432203,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x63be8be1f6558fd5!8m2!3d34.0696014!4d-118.4428746?shorturl=1) MS 8935. 
My research focuses on applied statistics, in particular in the fields of climate science, the life sciences, and education.
