## Guidelines for requesting a letter of recommendation
I am happy to write letters of recommendation for students I know and recognize.

Make yourself known to me
If you anticipate requesting a letter of recommendation, please put forth a strong effort to make yourself known to me as a student.

This includes doing things like:

Sitting near the front of the classroom, being engaged, and actively participating in class
In online classes: Keeping your webcam on and actively participating in class
Visiting me during office hours:
To ask questions to gain a deeper understanding of the material. This demonstrates your curiosity and drive to learn.
To ask for help with homework. This demonstrates your willingness to work hard and overcome obstacles.
To share about your ambitions, goals, or other interests.
When you make a visit in office hours, be sure to introduce yourself by name. You may need to do this several times until I begin to say hello to you by name.
Actively participating in class discussion forums (not anonymously) to show your ability to explain concepts and help others.
Requesting the letter
When making your request, please do it in person or via Zoom. If I agree to write your letter of recommendation, please send me an email with the following materials.
