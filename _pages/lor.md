# Guidelines for Requesting a Letter of Recommendation
I am happy to write letters of recommendation for students I know and recognize.

## Make Yourself Known to Me
If you anticipate requesting a letter of recommendation, please put forth a strong effort to make yourself known to me as a student.

This includes doing things like:

- Sitting near the front of the classroom, being engaged, and actively participating in class
- In online classes: Keeping your webcam on and actively participating in class
- Visiting me during **office hours**:
    - To ask questions to gain a deeper understanding of the material. This demonstrates your curiosity and drive to learn.
    - To ask for help with homework. This demonstrates your willingness to work hard and overcome obstacles.
    - To share about your ambitions, goals, or other interests.
    - When you make a visit in office hours, be sure to **introduce yourself by name**. You may need to do this several times until I begin to say hello to you by name.
- Actively participating in class discussion forums (not anonymously) to show your ability to explain concepts and help others.

## Requesting the Letter
When making your request, please do it in person or via a short email. Feel free to include a photo of yourself and which classes you took with me in which quarters to help me remember who you are. If I agree to write your letter of recommendation, please send me an email with the following materials:

### Materials
- A short summary of who you are and how I should know you. If you have any stories that will help me remember you, that is also helpful. For example, "I always sat in the front row of STATS 20 and would stay after class to ask questions about the code I wrote during class. One day we had a conversation about how R pretends to offer vectorized operations when under the hood it's just for loops in C."
- List all classes you took with me and which quarter you took them.
- Printout or screen-capture of the grades you earned in my classes from BruinLearn. If you are able to include the actual assignment grades, that is also helpful.
- Current UCLA transcript (unofficial is fine). If you are a transfer student or UCLA Extension student, you can include transcripts from your other schools.
- Resume
- A current picture of yourself (to jog my memory who you are)
- Link to your LinkedIn profile (if you have one)
- Any other information you believe will be useful for writing a letter
- A list of particular topics / stories that you would like me to mention in the letter. For example, your group did an impressive project in my M148 class and I praised your work.
- (Optional) A draft of your Personal Statement / Research Statement / Statement of Purpose; in particular if you mention my name in it, which could be a good idea if I am on your list of personal references.
- The email you send me (after I agree to writing your letter) should have the subject line in the following format: "Joe Bruin - Recommendation Letter Materials. First Deadline: Dec 15 20XX"

In summary, I have a lot of students, so anything you can do to help me really remember who you are will be helpful. Also, do not count on me actively remembering any specifics. Send me as much information as possible to get the best possible letter of recommendation. There's no need to be humble.

### No Gifts
Do not give me any gifts. You may express your gratitude with a thank you card. You can consider leaving a positive review on a website. I cannot accept gifts of monetary value.
